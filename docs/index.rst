Open Notificaties Documentation
===============================

**Open Notificaties** is a modern, open-source messaging service that implements the
`VNG API standard for the "Notificaties API"`_ in line with the `Common Ground`_ model.
Among others, it can be used in combination with `Open Zaak`_ which implements the
`VNG standards for "API's voor Zaakgericht werken"`_ that require a Notificaties API.
